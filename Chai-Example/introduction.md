// What is unit testing? In chapter 6 we are unit testing. Unit testing simply means testing the behavior of code in small, independant units. Units are typically designed to be the smallest meaningful chuncks of independantly testable code. Reading and writing unit tests is an important essential skill for most software engineers. 
// You will notice Chai and Mocha are often times used together. Chai is a library and can be paired with any Javascript testing framework (Mocha). Chai provides us with several APIs like Assert, Expect/Should, ect. Mocha provides all the functionality required for autimated testing in simpiler ways. 
// What is Chai.js? Well, Chai provides various functions and methods in a clean syntax that compares the output of a certain test with its expected value.
